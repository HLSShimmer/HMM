# HMM
This is a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** class implemented with matlab code. Has the basic function of setting&amp;retrieve model, generate state&amp;observe sequence, optimize model by using Baum-Welch Algo, ect.
## Access to the code
Run the **test.m** file, will execute the demo of a HMM model with discrete observe distribution.
Run the **testContinuousObservance.m** file, will execute the demo of a HMM model with continuous observe pdf.
Run the **testGenerateSequence.m** file, will execute the demo of a HMM model generating state&observe sequence.
